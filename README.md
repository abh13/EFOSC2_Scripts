Polarisation scripts for the EFOSC2 instrument on the NTT at La Silla, Chile.

The EFOSC2_Pol_Calc.py script calibration functionality is described in Wiersema et al. 2018, PASA 35, e012.
The scripts have been improved with additional wavelengths, better fitting routines and error catching.
Please see the guide for usage.

We have also added the EFOSC2_Image_Red.py and EFOSC2_Pol_Phot.py scripts for completeness, demonstrating how the
user can start with the raw observing data and obtain the final polarimetric measurements.

The EFOSC2_Pol_Files_2016.zip contain the unpolarised standard star data described
in the above paper. The EFOSC2_Pol_Files.zip folder contains unpolarised star measurements
from a 2018 observing run and includes observations in additional filters.
