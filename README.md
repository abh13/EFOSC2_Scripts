Polarisation scripts for the EFOSC2 instrument on the NTT at La Silla, Chile.

The EFOSC2_Pol_Calc.py script is described in Wiersema et al. 2018, PASA 35, e012. 
We have added the EFOSC2_Image_Red.py and EFOSC2_Pol_Phot.py scripts for
completeness.

*** NOTE: The scripts were originally written in Python3.5. As of July 2018 there
may be an issue with photutils v0.4 if you have numpy v1.14 and/or Python3.7. ***
