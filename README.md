Polarisation scripts for the EFOSC2 instrument on the NTT at La Silla, Chile.

The EFOSC2_Pol_Calc.py script is described in Wiersema et al. 2018, PASA 35, e012. 
We have added the EFOSC2_Image_Red.py and EFOSC2_Pol_Phot.py scripts for
completeness.

The EFOSC2_Pol_Files_2016.zip contain the unpolarised standard star data described
in the above paper. The EFOSC2_Pol_Files.zip folder contains unpolarised star measurements
from a 2018 observing run and includes observations in additional filters.
